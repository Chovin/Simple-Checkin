# Simple-Checkin
simple gym checkin form and dashboard

## Installation

* cd into the project folder
* `npm install`

## Usage

* `npm run start`
* to run on a separate port (3000 for instance): `npm run start -- 3000`

## Considerations

* You may want to put it behind a reverse proxy like nginx for https
* the `checkins` folder needs to be read/writable by whatever is running node
